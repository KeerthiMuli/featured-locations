# RFP - Featured Location
## Statement Of Purpose 
We would  like to build an app wherein we'll develop a city guide for Maryville. A city guide is a must-have for us whenever we visit to a new location. It not only offers us with essential city information, but it also saves us time. This will undoubtedly assist users in saving critical time that cannot be replaced, as well as being economically viable.
## Objective
The primary goal of the city guide app designed for Maryville is to provide users with accurate, up-to-date, and relevant information about everything they need to know when visiting Maryville. It is a web-based platform that stores information about Maryville City and assists all users who have just visited our website and registered. They may search for prominent places in the city and also users can add locations and do updates without the assistance of a human guide. The website provides comprehensive information about hotels, hospitals, schools, and gas stations in Maryville. Any anybody with a basic understanding of the internet can utilize this website.
